# ProsperLoan Data Exploration
## Alex Akaolisah


## Dataset
>The ProsperLoan [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barun2104/telecom-churn) provided by udacity consists of 113937 rows and 81 columns of loan data.This corresponds to 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

>The exploration carried out on the dataset was geared towards generating insights on the factors that affected the LenderYield. These explorations included:
- Assess and wrangle the dataset in form of preliminary preparation
- Explore the dataset using appropriate plots to present findings and reveal relationships between variables.
- Create pictorial Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate plots to show these relationships.

### Preliminary Wrangling
- This involved visual and programmatic assessment of the dataset for quality and tidyness concerns
- necessary data transformations were done as demanded by the visualisation options of choice

## Summary of Findings

>Based on the result of the exploration, The following findings were arrived at:
- Higher Borrower interest rates resulted to higher Lender Yield
- Lenders to big borrowers (people that borrowed large sums) accepted lower Yield (ie lower interest rates for big loans)
- The higher the Prosper score assigned to a borrower, the lower the interest rate on the loans they borrowed and hence lower yield to lenders


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For presentation, The key focus is on the Prosper Rating and prosper scores. Lenders had more confidence on Borrowers who had high prosper ratings and high prosper scores hence they could borrow  higher sums at lower interest rates (Borrowerrate)
